A comprehensive educational resource for designing and building clocks and watches using MicroPython, AI, and low-cost components. This project combines low-cost hands-on electronics to make teaching computational thinking principles fun!

## 🌟 Features

- **Comprehensive Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides from basic setup to advanced projects including basic setup for students with no prior Python coding experience
- **Multiple Clock Kits**: 15+ different clock implementations including OLED, LED, NeoPixel, and e-paper displays
- **MicroPython Code**: Well-documented examples for various clock and watch platforms
- **AI Integration**: Use generative AI prompts to create custom clock designs
- **Interactive Simulations**: Browser-based microsimulations for learning concepts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Suggested Setup

- Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico W or compatible microcontroller
- Basic electronic components (displays, real-time clocks, breadboards)
- [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) for development
