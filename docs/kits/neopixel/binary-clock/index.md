# Binary Clock

![](./binary-clock-with-time.jpg)

The binary clock is a popular project where binary numbers are used to display the digits of a clock.

This kit just needs a Pico and a short segment of an LED strip - about 20 pixels.

We can create a very simple binary clock using a single NeoPixel LED strip
with just 12 pixels.

## MicroSim

You can see a simulation of the clock here:

Note that you can click the "Show Text Time" and "Show Values" to get a decoded human-understandable view of how to tell time with the clock.
