# NeoPixel LED Strip Clock Kits

![](./)

In this section we will present three clocks that use a string of low-cost RGB LEDs commonly
called NeoPixels.  The name of this standard is technically called the WS2812B
addressable LED standards.  NeoPixels are frequently used in art-clock projects
because they are:

1. **Easy to hook up** - just three wires can drive up to 400 RGB LED
2. **Low cost** - typically they sell for about $5/meter (60 pixels per meter) on eBay
3. **Available in many variations** - they come is strips of various densities, rings, matrices, string and fairy light configurations

We have an entire on-line course on how to
used these fun and colorful strips at our [Moving Rainbow](https://dmccreary.github.io/moving-rainbow/) website.  That site includes hundreds of step-by-step lesson plans
and sample programs for kids ranging from age 8 to 18.

In this book we have several examples of clocks built with NeoPixels.

1. **Binary Clock** This kit displays the time using binary numbers.  It is a little hard to read at first, but these kits are extremely popular. [Link to the Binary Clock Project](./binary-clock/index.md).  There are also several alternate layouts of how to display a binary clock.  There are six different NeoPixel strips, each strip requires about five minutes of soldering, so the assembly takes about an hour.  The total parts cost about $11.
2. **Seven Segment Clock** The second requires building four seven-segment displays from the LED strip (or LED string) so the assembly time is significantly longer - about three hours if you are good with a soldering iron.  [Link to the Seven Segment Clock Project](./seven-segment-clock/index.md)
3. **Fibonacci Clock** This clock is unusual since it requires a bit of time to be able to read the time.  However, it has what many consider the most elegant simple display.  [Link to the Fibonacci Clock Project](./fibonacci-clock/index.md).
