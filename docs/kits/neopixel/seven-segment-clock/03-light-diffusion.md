# NeoPixel Light Diffusion

To make a nice clock we need to design an effective diffusion system for NeoPixels that balances visibility and brightness.

For optimal diffusion while maintaining brightness, we recommend a multi-layer approach:

1. **Primary diffusion layer:** Use a thin (1-3mm) sheet of white acrylic with a light frost or matte finish, positioned about 5-10mm away from the NeoPixels. This distance allows enough space for the light to blend while keeping individual pixels distinguishable.

2. **Air gap:** The space between the NeoPixels and the diffusion layer is crucial. Too close and you'll see harsh spots; too far and you'll lose brightness. Start with 8mm and adjust based on your needs.

3. **Optional secondary diffusion:** If you need more smoothing, add a very thin (0.5-1mm) layer of standard white diffusion film about 2-3mm in front of the primary layer.

Some specific materials to consider:

- White acrylic with 30-50% light transmission
- Light Shaping Diffuser (LSD) film with 20Â° beam angle
- Frosted polycarbonate with light transmission around 80%

To maximize brightness while maintaining the pixel effect, you can also:

- Create a reflective cavity behind the NeoPixels using white material
- Use higher brightness NeoPixels (like the WS2812B-Eco)
- Consider adding small dividers between pixels if you want more definition
