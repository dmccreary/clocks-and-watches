![Clock Digit Lab](../../img/clock-digit-lab.png)

These are our most popular kits.  They use
a bright monochrome 128x64 OLED with either the Raspberry Pi Pico
or the Rasberry Pi Pico W.

The OLEDs are mounted on a piece of plastic with a half-size breaboard.

Each board has two buttons so you can adjust the time and alarm clock settings.
