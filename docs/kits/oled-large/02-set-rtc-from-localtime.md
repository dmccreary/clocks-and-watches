# Set RTC form the localtime

When you plug your Pico into your PC and use the Thonny IDE, the MicroPython runtime will startup and get the time from your desktop or laptop computer's clock and set the MicroPython runtimes localtime() with this time.

!!! Note
    You can disable the Thonny localtime if you want to test the RTC functions.
