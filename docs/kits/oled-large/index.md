# Large OLED Kit

![Clock Digit Lab](./oled-large-v2.png)

The Large OLED Kit is one of our most popular kits.  They use
a bright monochrome 128x64 OLED with either the Raspberry Pi Pico
or the Raspberry Pi Pico W.  We also suggest using the DS3231
to keep time accurate to within 2 seconds per month.

The OLEDs are mounted on a piece of acrilic (Plexiglass) with a half-size breaboard.

Each board has three buttons so you can adjust the time and alarm clock settings
manually.
