# Manually Setting Time on Power Up

This clock has two buttons on a breadboard for setting the time.
When the clock is powered up or reset, the clock goes into
a "Power-Up" mode where all the digits are flashing.

Here are the modes we will need:

1. **Normal Clock Running**
2. **Setting the Hour**
3. **Setting the Minute**
4. **Setting the AM/PM**
