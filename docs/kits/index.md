### TinySSD1306 OLED with an I2C Interface


This small low-cost OLED display is easy to hook up with just 4 wires.
The combination of low-cost and easy hookup makes it an ideal
starter project.

We hav purchased these OLEDs on eBay for under $4 each.  Some of
they have the first 20 rows yellow and the remaining 44 rows blue.
