## Description

This MicroSim provides an interactive visualization of the learning graph for the "Clocks and Watches with MicroPython" course. It shows the relationships between concepts, prerequisites, and learning pathways using the vis-network library.

Key features:

- Interactive node-based graph visualization
- Zoom and pan navigation
- Click on nodes to see concept details
- Visual representation of concept dependencies

### How to Use

1. Click and drag to pan around the graph
2. Use scroll wheel to zoom in/out
3. Click on nodes to highlight connections
4. Drag nodes to rearrange the layout

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After exploring this visualization, students will be able to:

- Identify the major concept areas in clock and watch programming
- Trace prerequisite relationships between concepts
- Plan a learning path through the material

### Target Audience

- Grade level: High school to undergraduate
- Prerequisites: None (this is a planning tool)

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Navigate the graph to find all concepts related to displays
2. **Guided Investigation**: Trace the path from basic concepts to advanced topics
3. **Extension Activity**: Identify which concepts have the most prerequisites
