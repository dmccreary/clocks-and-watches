# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    You are an expert at generating concept lists for online training courses.
    Please generate a list of the 200 core concepts that need to be covered in this course and the order in which they should be taught.

    Return numbered list of these core concepts using a single line per concept. For each concept, just return a short concept name and use acronyms or abbreviations when appropriate. They will be used as labels in a graph network. Make sure that the concepts are distinct not duplicated in the list.

    Use title case for the concept names.

    Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then proceed to the most complex concepts.
