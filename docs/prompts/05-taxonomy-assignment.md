    That is very good.  Now please return a new CSV file that appends the TaxonomyID as the fourth column.  The new CSV file you create now has the following format:

        1. The first column in the CSV file is a numeric ConceptID
        ID you assigned in the CSV file above.
        2. The second column is the ConceptLabel from the CSV file above.
        3. The third column is a pipe-delimited Dependencies of the Concept IDs that the concept depends upon.
        4. The fourth column is the numeric TaxonomyID from the taxonomy you generated above.
