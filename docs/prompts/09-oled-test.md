# OLED TEST

## Sample Prompt

!!! prompt
    I am working on a program written in MicroPython.
    I have a 128x64 OLED using a standard ssd1306 chip on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
    I have the ssd1306.py driver loaded into the /lib directory.  The i2c.scan()
    function test result is PASS with PASS: OLED Found on dec: 60 hex: 0x3c.

    Please write a MicroPython program that prints "Hello World!" on the OLED display.  Use the config.py program in the project to setup
    the display.
