# Prompts

Here is a list of some of the many prompts that we used to
generate a learning graph for this course as well as
generate content such as lesson plans and sample code.

Although we are only listing some of the prompts here,
you can use the search function with the "prompt" to see many more sample prompts.

We believe that great intelligent textbooks not only help you write code, they teach you how to help you effectively use GenAI tools to create better code.

Note that most prompts have a "Copy" button in the upper right corner
of the prompt.  You can use this button to copy the prompt text directly into your generative AI tool.
