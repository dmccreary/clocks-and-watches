# AI in the Classroom

## Sample Prompts
This course provides many sample [prompts](../prompts/index.md) you
can use to give generative AI systems to
explain code, generate sample code, generate tests and modify our existing
code to add new features.

Teachers can also use these prompts to create lesson plans and learning artifacts such as [MicroSims](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/) to complement these
resources.

## Leveraging Projects

We also encourage you to load the kit source code into a project area that your generative AI tools can access.  Both [Anthropic's Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/projects) and [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-using-projects-in-chatgpt).  This allows you to do
things like reference a sample program and say *just like example 07-clock-face.py but with red digits*.
