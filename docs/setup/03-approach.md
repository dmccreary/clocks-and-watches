# Our Learning Approach

Our strategy for teaching is to provide a base
set of examples of working clocks and watches. We then also
provide a set of "Challenges" for students to go
further.

We also provide a sample set of prompts you
can use to feed generative AI systems to
create other lesson plans and learning artifacts such as [MicroSims](https://dmccreary.github.io/microsims/) to complement these
resources.
