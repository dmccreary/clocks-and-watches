![](../img/pico-vs-pico-w.png)

When installing the Pico "W" (Wireless), you will need to download
a different version of the MicroPython runtime.

The list of runtime images is on the
[https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/) page.

In this example, we are using [v1.24.1 (2024-11-29) .uf2](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.24.1).

Here is the image from Thonny that shows
what version you are using.  Note that you MUST select BOTSEL button
before Thonny will download the new MicroPython runtime.
