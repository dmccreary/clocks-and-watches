# Button Print Test

In this lab we will be testing if the three buttons have been
wired up correctly.  When we press any of the three buttons
we will see the event printed on the Thonny console.

By printing to the console this lab is not dependant on the
display being connected.  In the next lab we will also modify the
lab to display the button state on the display.

## Using Interrupt Request Functions

To print what button is being pressed, we will write three small python functions.
We then will then have these functions run when the corresponding button is presssed by running the ```irq``` function.
