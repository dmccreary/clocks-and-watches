# Clock and Watch Lessons

These lessons are general to all of our kits.  We often use the
Pico OLED for many examples since that is the kit
we have been using for the longest time.

These lessons focus on using functions like the 
MicroPython localtime() to get the time in your
current timezone.

They also focus on drawing scalable numbers on
different size displays and drawing times
on larger color displays.
