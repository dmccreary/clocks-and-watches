# Building Clocks and Watches with Smart Watch Displays

These lessons are general to all of our kits.  We often use the
Pico OLED for many examples since that is the kit
we have been using for the longest time.

These lessons focus on using functions like the 
MicroPython localtime() to get the time in your
current timezone.

They also focus on drawing scalable numbers on
different size displays and drawing times
on larger color displays.

Here are some sample lesson plans for a 14-week semimester
high school course on learning computational thining
by using MicroPython to write clock and smartwatch
application.  This course assumes no prior knowledge
of programming.

## **Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Python and Basic Concepts**

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

- Drawing a simple rectangle to the screen
- Making the rectangle bounce around the screen
- Understanding Python syntax
- Using the graphics library for your clock or watch

### Lesson 3: Variables and Data Types
- Introduction to variables
- Common data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
- Drawing with pixels, lines and rectangles
- Changing color

### Lesson 4: Basic Operations
- Arithmetic operations

- Lists of colors

## **Weeks 3-4: Control Structures and Functions**

### Lesson 5: Conditionals
- `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- Alternating the color of your lines
- Horizontal and radial lines

### Lesson 6: Loops
- `for` and `while` loops
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`
- Draing the tick marks on a watch

### Lesson 7: Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments and return values

## **Weeks 5-6: Working with Libraries and Hardware**

### Lesson 8: Importing Libraries
- What is a library?
- Importing and using libraries

### Lesson 9: Introduction to Hardware Interaction

- Updating the time

## **Weeks 9-10: Intermediate Python Concepts**

### Lesson 12: Lists and Dictionaries
- Creating and manipulating lists and dictionaries

### Lesson 13: Error Handling
- `try` and `except` blocks

## **Weeks 11-12: Project 2: Analog Clock Display**

### Lesson 14: Planning the Project
- Project overview
- Creating a project plan

### Lesson 15: Building an Analog Clock Display
- Designing an analog clock
- Rotating clock hands based on the current time

## **Weeks 13-14: Advanced Python Concepts and Optimization**

### Lesson 16: More About Functions
- Lambda functions, higher-order functions

### Lesson 17: Optimization Techniques
- Improving code efficiency

## **Weeks 15-16: Final Project: Customizable Clock/Watch**

### Lesson 18: Planning the Project
- Project overview
- Creating a project plan

### Lesson 19: Building a Customizable Clock/Watch
- Adding customization options (color, style, etc.)
- Implementing user input for customization

### Lesson 20: Final Project Presentations
- Students present their final projects
- Review and feedback session

## **Ongoing: Reflection and Feedback**

- After each project, have students reflect on what went well, what they struggled with, and what they learned.
- Continuously solicit feedback from students to improve the learning experience.

This outline provides a balance between teaching Python concepts and applying them to real-world projects, which can keep students engaged and help them to better retain what they've learned. Tailor this outline to meet the specific needs and pace of your students, and ensure to provide plenty of opportunities for students to practice their skills, ask questions, and get feedback.
