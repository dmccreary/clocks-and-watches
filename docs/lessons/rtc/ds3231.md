# DS3231 Real-time Clock

![](../../img/rtc-ds3231-front-back.jpg)

The DS3231 is a temperature-compensated real-time clock Released by Maxim Integrated around 2009-2010. With integrated crystal and I2C interface that maintains highly accurate timekeeping under varying conditions.

The DS3231 represented a significant advancement in accuracy and temperature compensation over the earlier DS1307. The improved technology helped make the DS3231 the preferred choice for precision timekeeping applications, despite its higher cost. The DS3231m typically maintains an accuracy of ±2 seconds each month (not day) across an incredible range of -40°F to 185°F (-40°C to +85°C). The DS3231 also has an on-board register you can access to get the current temperature of the device.

## Key Technical and Financial Differences:

**Accuracy**
- DS1307: ±2 seconds/day
- DS3231: ±2 seconds/month due to temperature compensation

**Temperature Operation:**

- DS1307: 32°F to 158°F (0°C to +70°C)
- DS3231: -40°F to 185°F (-40°C to +85°C) with compensation

**Clock Output:**

- DS1307: Programmable square wave (1Hz, 4kHz, 8kHz, 32kHz)
- DS3231: 32kHz output plus programmable square wave

**Typical retail prices as of 2025:**

- DS1307: $1-2 USD
- DS3231: $3-5 USD
