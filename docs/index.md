# MicroPython Clocks and Watches

This website is dedicated to students who want to learn how to
design their own digital clocks and watches using Python.  It contains
instructions for finding low-cost parts and creating your own custom
clock and watch displays.

These projects have only recently been possible due to the following developments:

1. The support of highly optimized drawing of complex ellipse and polygon shapes by the MicroPython runtime at version 19 was announced in early 2023.
2. The ability of clocks to synchronize with centralized time services using
standard WiFi networks using the $5 Raspberry Pi Pico W.
3. The availability of low-cost high-contrast OLED and TFT displays for as low as $7 each.

Our goal is to provide fun ways to teach computational thinking to a wide variety of students from 6th to 12th grade.  If you can type we have fun lesson plans from drawing simple shapes to complex clock and watch face designs.

If you have any comments or feedback, please feel free to post these to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dmccreary/micropython-watch/issues).

Good Luck! [Dan McCreary on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/)
